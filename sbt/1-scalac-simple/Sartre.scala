    "In 1787, at an inn near Moulins, an old man was dying, a friend of Diderot, trained by the
    philosophers. The priests of the neighbourhood were nonplussed: they had tried everything in vain; the
    good man would have no last rites, he was a pantheist. M. de Rollebon, who was passing by and who
    believed in nothing, bet the Cure of Moulins that he would need less than two hours to bring the sick
    man back to Christian sentiments. The Cure took the bet and lost: Rollebon began at three in the
    morning, the sick man confessed at five and died at seven. "Are you so forceful in argument?" asked
    the Cure, "You outdo even us." "I did not argue," answered M. de Rollebon, "I made him fear Hell."
