# Working without sbt

How do the one compile Scala (or Java, or C) file without a built tool. It is
quite easy to do. If you have a compiler, you can do it directly. Let's compile
the application in `introduction` directory directly as an excersise:
```
# assuming you are at `scala-bootstrap/sbt`
cd 1-scalac-simple

# let's compile the stuff now
# (run `scalac --help` if you want to know more)
scalac Sartre.scala

# let's run it! (why we are not using `.scala` at the end?)
# (run `scala --help` if you want to know more)
scala Sartre

# it wasn't so hard, may be no need for build tools?
# let' see what your compiler generated:
# (use `dir` instead of `ls -l` on Windows)
ls -l

# wow, what are all these files? how do we clean them up?
```

What if we need to use the libraries to run our code? Let's try to compile the
project without adding libraries first.
```
# assuming you are at `scala-bootstrap/sbt`
cd 2-scalac-libs

# let's try compile the stuff now (there will be an error)
scalac Knuth.scala
```

Got errors? We need cats-effect. Where we take the artifact?
Let's go Maven central: https://search.maven.org/
Search for `cats-effect_2.13-2.2.0.jar` and press `Download` arrow
at the right of the row.

Select `jar`, download it and put it to `scala-bootstrap/sbt/2-scalac-libs` near
`Knuth.scala` file.
```
scalac Knuth.scala

# Hurray! We have it compiled! Let's try to run it now:
scala Knuth

# I got an error? Why did I? How to fix it?
```

This felt like a real pain to me. Did you feel it too? The real Scala or Java
applications may have hundreds of dependencies. Downloading them manually,
copying in the right place and running could be a huge pain without the appropriate
tools.

# Build tools

There are plenty of the builds tools in the programming world. One of most known
is, arguably, `make` and derivatives, which is very well known to `C/C++` crowd.

In JVM world, one of the first very popular tools was
[`Apache Ant`](https://ant.apache.org/), which allowed developers to specify the
commands to execute using, then popular, prescriptive XML format. I.e. you would
say to Ant where to take the files and where to put them like this:
```
<copy file="myfile.txt" todir="../some/other/dir"/>
```

The prescriptive tools went out of fashion, because the people tend to create
the very different projects, without own conventions etc., which are hard to
follow and reuse outside specific teams.

One of the first and very popular tool was Maven, which I mentioned before.

To quote wikipedia:
> The word itself is a borrowing from the Yiddish מבֿין meyvn 'an expert,
connoisseur', derived from the Hebrew מבין‎ mēvīn 'person with understanding,
teacher', a participle of the verb הֵבִין‎ hēvīn '(he) understood'...

The idea was to use "Convention over Configuration" principle a lot and make
sure most of the projects use the same structure. Then compiling, running,
testing etc. the code would be about putting it to the right directories.

# Working with sbt

`sbt`, which used to mean "Simple Build Tool" is a continuation of this
tradition. Despite the name, `sbt` used to be really hard to use and understand
with awkward symbols, conventions and ideas. This is _not_ the case anymore,
it has been simplified and is easy to use these days, but I am sharing this,
because you might encounter such an opinion based on an experience of previous versions of SBT.

Because it was so infamous, and out of strive to innovate, other tools appeared
in Scala word since then. Most people still use sbt though.
- http://www.lihaoyi.com/mill/ by Li Haoyi, from Databricks, whom I mentioned before,
- https://github.com/propensive/fury by Jon Pretty from Propensive, a famous and
  very respected Scala developer.

In large mixed corporate environments where Scala is not the only backend
language, often other, not Scala specific tools are used:
- https://maven.apache.org/ the original XML reading beast by ASF,
- https://gradle.org/ popular modern build tool by Gradle Inc.,
- https://bazel.build/ scalable polyglot tool to build huge repositories by Google.

Let's try to see if sbt could fix the pain highlighted above? Let's try to
compile almost exactly the same project (except the name) we did with sbt.

```
# assuming you are at `scala-bootstrap/sbt`
cd 3-sbt-simple

# let's ask sbt to run (it will know it needs to compile first)
sbt run

# let's see if we have any garbage there now
# (use `dir` or File Explorer instead of `ls -l` on Windows)
ls -l

# wow, isn't it neat, no more garbage in a root directory
```

It looks almost magical. We did not need to specify files to compile,
we did not have to specify file to run and everything just worked out.
How did sbt know what to do? We will find out a bit later. Let's
try the magic on our project with libraries first.

```
# assuming you are at `scala-bootstrap/sbt`
cd 4-sbt-libs

# let's ask sbt to run it
sbt run

# oh no, error again
```

Obviously, it cannot guess magically what libraries we are to use,
though it can guess about the transitive dependencies.

Let's specify the libraries we want to use. For that create `build.sbt`
file in `4-sbt-libs` directory and add the following line into it:
```
libraryDependencies += "org.typelevel" %% "cats-effect" % "2.5.4"
```

Let's try to run it again?
```
sbt run
```
It works! Note that when we run `scala` directly, we could not get it working
because of transitive dependencies. In this case, actually, sbt detected by
itself that additional libraries are requires, downloaded and put them
into the right place.

Have a look at generate `project/build.properties` file. What does it contain?
Why?
