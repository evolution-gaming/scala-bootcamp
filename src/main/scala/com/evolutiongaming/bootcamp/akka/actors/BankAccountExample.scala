  // actors are completely independently executed
  // actors run fully concurrently (there is no notion of a global synchronization)
  // actors are completely encapsulated and isolated from each other (share nothing, no direct access is possible)

  // an actor is effectively single-threaded:
  // it will receive its messages, one after the other
  // for each message, it will invoke its behavior, possibly change the behavior for the next message and move on
  // processing one message is the atomic unit of execution
  // blocking is replaced by simply enqueueing messages, for later execution.
