  /** *
    * Our lecture is dedicated to a library that is widely used within Scala community - Cats.
    * The name `Cats` alludes to Category theory and the library contains abstractions making our life easier.
    * We will see some type classes that are useful in our daily work.
    *
    * Quick re-cap: type classes allow us to extend functionality avoiding limitations of inheritance and in cases when
    * we can not modify the source code.
