  // WEBSOCKET

  // One of the main limitations of HTTP is its request-response model. The server can only send data to the
  // client, when the client requests it to. Unlike HTTP, WebSocket provides full-duplex communication. That
  // means the client and the server can send data to each other in both directions at the same time.

  // WebSocket is distinct from HTTP. However, both protocols use TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) as their
  // transport. In addition, WebSocket utilizes the same ports as HTTP by default (443 and 80) and uses HTTP
  // `Upgrade` header during its handshake. It means that, to establish a WebSocket connection, the client and
  // the server establish an HTTP connection first. Then the client proposes an upgrade to WebSocket. If the
  // server accepts, a new WebSocket connection is established.

  // WebSocket communication consists of frames (data fragments), which can be sent both by the client and
  // the server. Frames can be of several types:
  // * text frames contain text data;
  // * binary frames contain binary data;
  // * ping/pong frames check the connection (when sent from the server, the client responds automatically);
  // * other service frames: connection close frame, etc.

  // Developers usually directly work with text and binary frames only. In contrary to HTTP, WebSocket does
  // not enforce any specific message format, so frames can contain any text or binary data.
