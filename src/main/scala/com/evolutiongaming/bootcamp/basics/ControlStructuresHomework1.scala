  // IT company located in Wakanda is searching for a new programmer. Due to high interest it needs
  // a way to filter out candidates that are not suitable for this job.
  // They have a number of characteristics that give candidates points, and valid candidate
  // should earn at least 10 points.
  //
  // * Each year of experience gives candidate 1 point, but not more than 5
  // * If candidate has education, it gives him 3 points
  // * Each passed test gives candidate 1 point starting from 6th passed test.
  //   If candidate has passed less than 5 tests, they don't want to hire him in any case.
  // * They prefer candidates from their country, so being from Wakanda gives candidate 3 points.
  //   If the candidate is from any of the neighboring countries - Narnia, Skyrim or Amestris -
  //   candidate should get 1 point, otherwise - 0
  // * Summed stars on github also give points.
  //   1 point if candidate has 10 stars, 2 points for 100, 3 points for 1000 and so on,
  //   giving 1 point for each WHOLE new power of ten, e.g. 9 is still 0 points, 99 is still 1 point.
  //
  // All input is valid, e.g. candidate can't have negative years of experience
