  // Singleton objects are defined using `object`.
  // It is a class that has exactly one instance.

  // specific to instances of this trait or class.

  // Question. Is MutablePoint a good design? Why or why not?

  // Traits define a common interface that classes conform to. They are similar to Java's interfaces.

  // A trait can be thought of as a contract that defines the capabilities and behaviour of a component.

  // Subtyping
  // Where a given trait is required, a subtype of the trait can be used instead.

  // Classes and singleton objects can extend traits.
  //
  // This allows "programming to the interface" approach where you depend on traits instead of their
  // specific implementations (classes or objects).
  //
  // This makes code more reusable and testable.

  // Case Classes
  //
  // Case classes are like regular classes, but with extra features which make them good for modelling
  // immutable data. They have all the functionality of regular classes, but the compiler generates additional
  // code, such as:
  // - Case class constructor parameters are public `val` fields, publicly accessible
  // - `apply` method is created in the companion object, so you don't need to use `new` to create a new
  //   instance of the class
  // - `unapply` method which allows you to use case classes in `match` expressions (pattern matching)
  // - a `copy` method is generated
  // - `equals` and `hashCode` methods are generated, which let you compare objects & use them in collections
  // - `toString` method is created for easier debugging purposes
  // - extends Serializable
  //
  // Case object provides default equals, hashCode, unapply, toString methods, extends Serializable
  //
  // When declaring a case class, make it final. Otherwise someone may decide to inherit from it
  // case-to-case inheritance is prohibited

  // calls .apply method
  val point2 = Point(1, 2)
  println(point2.x)

  // calls .unapply method
  val Point(x, y) = point2

  val point3 = point2.copy(x = 3)
  println(point3.toString) // Point(3, 2)

  //
  // What should be the return type of the `move` method in `Shape`? In `Point` and other sub-types?

  // Generic classes and type parameters

  // In a similar way as we saw with polymorphic methods, classes and traits can also take type parameters.
  // For example, you can define a `Stack[A]` which works with any type of element `A`.

  // Question. Do you agree with how the stack is modelled here? What would you do differently?
