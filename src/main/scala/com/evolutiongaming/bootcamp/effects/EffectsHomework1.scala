/*
 * Homework 1. Provide your own implementation of a subset of `IO` functionality.
 *
 * Provide also tests for this functionality in EffectsHomework1Spec (which you should create).
 *
 * Refer to:
 *  - https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/datatypes/io.html
 *  - https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/api/cats/effect/IO$.html
 *  - https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/api/cats/effect/IO.html
 * about the meaning of each method as needed.
 *
 * There are two main ways how to implement IO:
 * - Executable encoding  - express every constructor and operator for our model in terms of its execution
 * - Declarative encoding - express every constructor and operator for our model as pure data in a recursive
 *                          tree structure
 *
 * While the real Cats Effect IO implementation uses declarative encoding, it will be easier to solve this
 * task using executable encoding, that is:
 *  - Add a `private val run: () => A` parameter to the class `IO` private constructor
 *  - Have most of the methods return a `new IO(...)`
 *
 * Ask questions in the bootcamp chat if stuck on this task.
