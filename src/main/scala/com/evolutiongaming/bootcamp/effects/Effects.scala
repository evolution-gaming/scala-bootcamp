/*
 * Side effects - Modifying or accessing shared state outside the local environment - producing an
 *                observable effect other than returning a value to the invoker.
 *
 *                For example - updating a global variable, reading/writing to disk/console.
 *
 * But don't we need to do these "side effects" to write useful programs?
 *
 * Yes, indeed we do.
 *
 * In functional programming we wrap side effects into "IO Monads":
 *  - This turns (or captures, or encodes) them into immutable data (pure values)
 *  - Keeps referential transparency so it is easier to refactor our programs and reason about them
 *  - We can evaluate them when we want
 *  - They can be sequentially executed
 *  - They can be used in `for`-comprehensions
 *  - They can model complex series of concurrent computations
 *
 * There are a number of popular libraries providing IO Monads in the Scala ecosystem, each with their
 * pros & cons:
 *  - Cats Effect - https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/ - versions 2 and 3
 *  - ZIO - https://zio.dev/
 *  - Monix - https://monix.io/
 *
 *  There are also ways how to write software without being tied to a particular IO Monad ("Tagless Final"
 *  pattern), but we will not discuss this in this lecture.
 *
 * Asynchronous Effects, as opposed to Scala Future-s, are lazy. Nothing is run until an "unsafe" method
 * is executed (by your code, or by the `IOApp` trait) - usually at the "end of the world".
 *
 * The IO Monad in Cats Effect is called `IO`.
 *
 * A value of type IO[A] is a computation which, when evaluated, can perform effects before returning a value
 * of type A.
 *
 * It is a data structure that represents a description of a side effecting computation.
 *
 * It describes synchronous or asynchronous computations that:
 * - On evaluation yield exactly one result
 * - Can end in either success or failure (and in case of failure, the `flatMap` chains get short-circuited)
 * - Can be canceled (if the user provides cancellation logic)
