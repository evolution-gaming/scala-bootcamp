## Package by type/layer

- Cons
    - inexpressive
    - top-level structure does not give you idea what app does
    - need check all packages
    - hard to identify dependencies
    - cyclic dependencies
    - code to abstraction
    - merge conflicts
    - dependency magnets, code gravity
    - always see redundant code (other features in packages)
    - packages are tightly coupled, can't "ship" in isolation (monolith)
    - fat compilation (poor parallelization)
- Pros
    - Easy to start with
    - MVP - minimal viable product
